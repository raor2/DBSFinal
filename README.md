Final Project for Database Systems S19

## Data Cleaning
The Area column from the 'employmentData.csv' includes all counties from the NY state, which we will be directly using. However, some area are specified as two or three counties together, such as: 'Albany-Rensselaer-Schenectady Counties', in this case, we duplicate the data three times and categorized them as Albany County, Rensselaer County and Schenectady County respectively.
