Final Project for Database Systems S19

## Area to County Mapping
The Area column from the 'employmentData.csv' includes all counties from the NY state, which we will be directly using. 

- 'pull_Area.py' creates a 'Area_Remap.csv' that output the distinct 'Area' column in the 'employmentData.csv' file and replicate any indivisual county to 'County'.

However, some area are specified as two or three counties together, such as: 'Albany-Rensselaer-Schenectady Counties', 
In this case, we duplicate the data three times and categorized them as Albany County, Rensselaer County and Schenectady County respectively. 

- This part of the mapping was done by hand.
